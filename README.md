# 🚀 Self-Healing API Gateway in Go

A **lightweight, self-healing API Gateway** built from scratch in **Go**.  
It automatically detects failing services, reroutes traffic, and brings services back gradually, all while exposing metrics and admin APIs. Think of it as a **mini Istio / Envoy**, written entirely from scratch.

---

## 🧠 What It Is

This project is **not your usual CRUD app** or URL shortener. It’s **infrastructure software**, designed to handle real-world traffic and failures.

Key highlights:

- Detect failing backend services automatically
- Route traffic away from unhealthy nodes
- Gradually reintegrate healthy services
- Expose metrics & admin APIs for observability

## 🤯 Why This Project Stands Out

Most developers build simple apps. Few venture into **systems-level, production-grade infrastructure**. This project demonstrates:

- **Systems thinking** – handling service failures and recovery automatically
- **Concurrency mastery** – goroutines, atomic operations, and channels
- **Networking & reverse proxy skills** – routing, load balancing, circuit breaking
- **Go expertise** – idiomatic, production-ready code

> This is the kind of project that **interviewers LOVE**.

## 🔥 Core Features

### 1️⃣ Smart Reverse Proxy

- Accepts incoming HTTP requests and forwards them to backend services
- Load balances using:
  - **Round-Robin**
  - **Least Connections**
  - **Weighted Routing**
- **Built with:** `net/http`, `httputil.ReverseProxy`

### 2️⃣ Health Checking Engine (Self-Healing Core)

- Periodically pings backend services
- Marks services as:
  - `HEALTHY`
  - `DEGRADED`
  - `DOWN`
- Automatically removes unhealthy nodes from routing
- **Built with:** Goroutines, `time.Ticker`, atomic state updates

### 3️⃣ Circuit Breaker (Netflix-Style)

- Tracks:
  - Failure rate
  - Timeout rate
- Opens the circuit when failures exceed thresholds
- Prevents cascading failures across services
- **Implementation includes:** Sliding window counters, state machine logic

### 4️⃣ Rate Limiting (Per Client / Per Route)

- Protects backend services with **Token Bucket** or **Leaky Bucket** algorithms
- Handles **per-client** and **per-route** limits
- **Built with:** `sync.Map` and time-based refill logic

### 5️⃣ Distributed Tracing IDs

- Injects `X-Request-ID` headers
- Logs request flows across services for **observability**
- Enables tracing and debugging in complex distributed systems

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **Concurrency:** Goroutines, channels, atomic operations
- **HTTP:** `net/http`, `httputil.ReverseProxy`
- **Observability:** Custom request IDs, logging, metrics endpoints

---

## 📈 Next Steps / Improvements

- Add **dynamic service discovery** (e.g., via Consul or etcd)
- Integrate **Prometheus metrics** for observability
- Add **configurable routing policies** and **failover strategies**
- Implement **advanced load balancing** (least latency, weighted round-robin, etc.)
